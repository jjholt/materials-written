abstract = {BACKGROUND:A combined approach for prosthetic attachment and control using a transcutaneous bone-anchored device and implanted muscle electrodes can improve function for upper-limb amputees. The bone-anchor provides a transcutaneous feed-through for muscle signal recording. This approach can be combined with targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) to further improve myoelectric control.
METHODS:A bone-anchored device was implanted trans-tibially in n = 8 sheep with a bipolar recording electrode secured epimysially to the peroneus tertius muscle. TMR was carried out in a single animalthe peroneus tertius was deinnervated and the distal portion of the transected nerve to the peroneus muscle was coapted to a transected nerve branch previously supplying the tibialis anterior muscle. For 12 weeks (TMR) or 19 weeks (standard procedure), epimysial muscle signals were recorded while animals walked at 2 km·h.
RESULTS:After 19 weeks implantation following standard procedure, epimysial recording signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was 18.7 dB (± 6.4 dB, 95% CI) with typical recordings falling in the range 10–25 dB. Recoveries in gait and muscle signals were coincident 6 weeks post-TMR; initial muscle activity was identifiable 3 weeks post-TMR though with low signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio compared with normal muscle recordings.
CONCLUSIONS:Following recovery, muscle signals were recorded reliably over 19 weeks following implantation. In this study, targeted reinnervation was successful in parallel with bone-anchor implantation, with recovery identified 6 weeks after surgery.},

We now report the use of an intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthesis that is designed to achieve osseocutaneous integration. Osseocutaneous integration differs from osseointegration because the aim is to create a stable interface among the implant, the bone, and the soft tissues. This reduces the risk of soft tissue infection and troublesome discharge, which are problems encountered with current osseointegrated implants that focus largely on the bone–implant interface. We describe our experience with an intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthesis in a case of transhumeral amputation with 2 years of follow-up.},

abstract = {The human body has evolved to maintain homeostasis through the covering of skin and mucous membranes, which separate the internal environment from the harsh and variable external milieu. Few structures naturally penetrate these coverings, and teeth are the only exception in human beings. Attempts to breach these barriers, to develop skin‐ penetrating, bone‐anchored amputation prostheses, can lead to opportunist invasion by microorganisms and subsequent infection, which can jeopardize the life of the individual. There are only a few fascinating examples where the integument of other species is interrupted without such dire consequences, and the deer antler is one such case. Deer antlers are cephalic bony appendages arising from the frontal bones of the skull of the males of most deer species, and are true transient skin‐penetrating structures. Antlers are subject to extreme loading during the rutting season and yet the skin–bone barrier remains intact. Here we show how deer antlers can be used as natural analogues for the successful development of specialized orthopaedic amputation prosthetics. We have used quantitative and qualitative findings from a study of the morphology of deer antlers to develop a device that mimics their structure, which creates a tight seal between the implant and the host tissues, for use in amputation prosthetics.},

Numerous sensory feedback systems have been proposed in literature to address this gap in prosthetic control; however, these systems have yet to be implemented for long term use. Methodologies for communicating prosthetic grasp and touch information are reviewed, including discussion of selected designs and test results.

	abstract = {Introduction 
        Sensory feedback is largely unavailable for persons with upper-limb amputation with conventional prostheses. The current study created a portable vibratory haptic feedback system integrated into the prosthesis to test its usefulness in gripping objects during daily life.
        Materials and Methods 
        Development involved optimizing a mapping algorithm between the force sensor and the feedback tactor vibration, developing a custom process for mounting a wireless force sensor onto the prosthetic thumb with reliable output, and developing an instrumented object for testing grip force accuracy. Clinical testing involved optimizing tactor placement, measuring grip force accuracy, measuring the ability to perform daily gripping tasks, and surveying prosthetic users' opinion of the system after using the vibratory haptic device at home. A total of six individuals with unilateral transradial amputation participated in this study.
        Results 
        The results demonstrated optimal tactor placement more proximal versus distal on the forearm. Accuracy with haptic versus no haptic feedback demonstrated that haptic feedback improved the grip force accuracy by 129\% (adjusted P = 0.041) for light grip force target (2 lb or 0.9 kg) in the nonportable system and 21\% (adjusted P = 0.051) for medium grip force target (10 lb or 4.5 kg) in the portable system. Haptic feedback did not statistically improve grip accuracy at strong grip forces (20 lb or 9.1 kg). Haptic feedback improved the gripping technique during the Assessment of Capacity for Myoelectric Control (ACMC) by 1.22 points, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.27, n = 4). The participants provided specific positive examples of how the vibratory haptic system was useful at home. The overall usability score was 3.6 where 4 indicated excellent and 0 indicated poor.
        Conclusions 
        This kind of system has potential to improve the lives of upper-limb prosthetic users.},

	abstract = {Somatosensory feedback of the hand is essential for object identification. Without somatosensory feedback, individuals cannot reliably determine the size or compliance of an object. Electrical nerve stimulation can restore localized tactile and proprioceptive feedback with intensity discrimination capability similar to natural sensation. We hypothesized that adding artificial somatosensation improves object recognition accuracy when using a prosthesis. To test this hypothesis, we provided different forms of sensory feedback–tactile, proprioceptive, or both–to two subjects with upper limb loss. The subjects were asked to identify the size or mechanical compliance of different foam blocks placed in the prosthetic hand while visually and audibly blinded. During trials, we did not inform the subjects of their performance, but did ask them about their confidence in correctly identifying objects. Finally, we recorded applied pressures during object interaction. Subjects were free to use any strategy they chose to examine the objects. Object identification was most accurate with both tactile and proprioceptive feedback. The relative importance of each type of feedback, however, depended on object characteristics and task. Sensory feedback increased subject confidence and was directly correlated with accuracy. Subjects applied less pressure to the objects when they had tactile pressure feedback. Artificial somatosensory feedback improves object recognition and the relative importance of tactile versus proprioceptive feedback depends on the test set. We believe this test battery provides an effective means to assess the impact of sensory restoration and the relative contribution of different forms of feedback (tactile vs. kinesthetic) within the neurorehabilitation field.},

abstract = {Endo-exo prosthetics (EEP), which belongs to the transcutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic systems (TOPS), provides an alternative bone-anchored rehabilitation method for transfemoral amputees. It led to the question of whether transmitted forces from prosthetic feet are perceptible by osseoperception resulting in proprioceptive feedback of ground conditions.
The following hypotheses emerged for our trial with the null hypothesis: EEP fitting after transfemoral amputation does not influence osseoperception. Alternative hypothesis 1: EEP patients achieve better osseoperception results than transfemoral amputees fitted with socket prosthesis. Alternative hypothesis 2: EEP carriers achieve comparable results with regards to their osseoperception as non-amputees.
N = 25 patients with EEP (mean age = 50,6 ± 9,4, male/female = 15/10) N = 25 patients with socket prostheses (mean age = 52,6 ± 13,1, male/female = 19/6) and N = 25 healthy volunteers were included in the experimental case-control study. In three blinded test modules (V1, V2, V3), the participants had to identify different degrees of shore hardness (c) of different materials (rubber balls (shore = 5-25c), foam cushions (shore = 5-30c), foam mats (shore = 5-30c) with their prosthetic foot (or a personally defined foot in healthy volunteers) without footwear and had to rank them into the correct order according to their tactile sensation and the degree of hardness. A maximum of 10 points could be scored per run.
This experimental observational study included N = 75 participants. The mean age for the entire cohort was 42.8 ± 16.6 years and the BMI was 26.0 ± 4.8. Our results show a significant level of differences in tactile osseoperception between all groups (p < 0.001). A correlation between the mean values of V1-3 and the PMQ2.0 as well as the mean values of K-Level and the prosthesis wearing time per day showed for PMQ (r = 0.387, p = 0.006) and K-level (r = 0.448, p = 0.001) which is a moderate effect according to Cohen.
Our study results suggest that the EEP treatment can lead to an improvement in tactile sensory perception via the bone-anchored implant, which can lead to an increase in quality of life and improved gait safety.},

abstract = {In the past 50 years, bone anchored prostheses have evolved from a concept for experimental treatment to a rapidly developing area in orthopedics and traumatology. Up to date, there are dozens of centers in the world providing osseointegration amputation reconstructions and more than a thousand patients using the bone anchored prostheses. Compared with conventional socket prostheses, the bone anchored prosthesis by osseointegration avoids the debilitating problems related with soft tissues. It also provides physiological weight bearing, improved range of motion, and sensory feedback, all of which contribute to the improvement on quality of life for amputees. The present article briefly reviews the historical development of osseointegration surgery for amputation reconstruction and the current challenges. The implant design characters and surgical techniques of the two types of implants; the screw-type implant (presented by the OPRA system), and the press-fit implants (presented by EEP and OPL systems) are described. The major complications, infections and mechanical failures, are discussed in detail based on the latest evidence. Future aspects and experimental trials aiming to overcome the current challenges are presented.},

abstract = {Advent of additive manufacturing in biomedical field has nurtured fabrication of complex, customizable and reproducible orthopaedic implants. Layer-by-layer deposition of biodegradable polymer employed in development of porous orthopaedic screws promises gradual dissolution and complete metabolic resorption thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional metallic screws. In the present study, screws with different pore sizes (916 × 918 μm to 254 × 146 μm) were 3D printed at 200 μm layer height by varying printing parameters such as print speed, fill density and travel speed to augment the bone ingrowth. Micro-CT analysis and scanning electron micrographs of screws with 45% fill density confirmed porous interconnections (40.1%) and optimal pore size (259 × 207 × 200 μm) without compromising the mechanical strength (24.58 ± 1.36 MPa). Due to the open pore structure, the 3D printed screws showed increased weight gain due to the deposition of calcium when incubated in simulated body fluid. Osteoblast-like cells attached on screw and infiltrated into the pores over 14 days of in vitro culture. Further, the screws also supported greater human mesenchymal stem cell adhesion, proliferation and mineralized matrix synthesis over a period of 21 days in vitro culture as compared to non-porous screws. These porous screws showed significantly increased vascularization in a rat subcutaneous implantation as compared to control screws. Porous screws produced by additive manufacturing may promote better osteointegration due to enhanced mineralization and vascularization.

Using Strain Energy Density (SED) thresholds as the stimulus for adaptive bone remodelling, the validated model illustrated that: (a) bone apposition increased and resorption decreased with increasing implant stem flexibility in early stance; (b) bone apposition decreased (mean change = − 9.8%) and resorption increased (mean change = 20.3%) from distal to proximal in most stem stiffness models in early stance. By engineering the flow of force through the implant/bone (e.g. by changing material properties) these results demonstrate how periprosthetic bone remodelling, thus aseptic loosening, can be managed. This paper finds that future implant designs should be optimised for bone strain under a variety of relevant loading conditions using finite element models to maximise the chances of clinical success.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To systematically review studies evaluating the influence of surgical experience on individual performance.
BACKGROUND:Experience, measured in case volume or years of practice, is recognized as a key driver of individual surgical performance, giving rise to a learning curve. However, this topic has not been reviewed at the cross-specialty level.
METHODS:MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched (from inception to February 2013). Two reviewers independently reviewed citations using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ninety-one data points per study were extracted.
RESULTS:The search strategy yielded 6950 citations. Fifty-seven studies were eligible, including 1,061,913 cases and 35 procedure types, performed by 17,912 surgeons. Forty-five studies monitored case volume, and 6 studies measured experience as both case volume and years of practice. Of these 51 studies, 44 found that increased case volume was associated with significantly improved health outcomes. Several studies noted a plateau phase or maturation in the surgical learning curve. Acquisition of this phase was procedure specific and outcome specific, ranging from 25 to 750 procedures. Twelve studies assessed the impact of years of surgical practice, 11 of which found that increased years of experience was associated with significantly improved health outcomes. Two studies noted a plateau phase, where increases in years of experience were no longer associated with improvements in operative outcomes. Three studies identified performance deterioration after the plateau phase.
CONCLUSIONS:Increasing surgical case volume and years of practice are associated with improved performance, in a procedure-specific manner. Performance may deteriorate toward the end of a surgeonʼs career.},
