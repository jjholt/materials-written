abstract = {BACKGROUND:A combined approach for prosthetic attachment and control using a transcutaneous bone-anchored device and implanted muscle electrodes can improve function for upper-limb amputees. The bone-anchor provides a transcutaneous feed-through for muscle signal recording. This approach can be combined with targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) to further improve myoelectric control.
METHODS:A bone-anchored device was implanted trans-tibially in n = 8 sheep with a bipolar recording electrode secured epimysially to the peroneus tertius muscle. TMR was carried out in a single animalthe peroneus tertius was deinnervated and the distal portion of the transected nerve to the peroneus muscle was coapted to a transected nerve branch previously supplying the tibialis anterior muscle. For 12 weeks (TMR) or 19 weeks (standard procedure), epimysial muscle signals were recorded while animals walked at 2 km·h.
RESULTS:After 19 weeks implantation following standard procedure, epimysial recording signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was 18.7 dB (± 6.4 dB, 95% CI) with typical recordings falling in the range 10–25 dB. Recoveries in gait and muscle signals were coincident 6 weeks post-TMR; initial muscle activity was identifiable 3 weeks post-TMR though with low signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio compared with normal muscle recordings.
CONCLUSIONS:Following recovery, muscle signals were recorded reliably over 19 weeks following implantation. In this study, targeted reinnervation was successful in parallel with bone-anchor implantation, with recovery identified 6 weeks after surgery.},

We now report the use of an intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthesis that is designed to achieve osseocutaneous integration. Osseocutaneous integration differs from osseointegration because the aim is to create a stable interface among the implant, the bone, and the soft tissues. This reduces the risk of soft tissue infection and troublesome discharge, which are problems encountered with current osseointegrated implants that focus largely on the bone–implant interface. We describe our experience with an intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthesis in a case of transhumeral amputation with 2 years of follow-up.},

abstract = {The human body has evolved to maintain homeostasis through the covering of skin and mucous membranes, which separate the internal environment from the harsh and variable external milieu. Few structures naturally penetrate these coverings, and teeth are the only exception in human beings. Attempts to breach these barriers, to develop skin‐ penetrating, bone‐anchored amputation prostheses, can lead to opportunist invasion by microorganisms and subsequent infection, which can jeopardize the life of the individual. There are only a few fascinating examples where the integument of other species is interrupted without such dire consequences, and the deer antler is one such case. Deer antlers are cephalic bony appendages arising from the frontal bones of the skull of the males of most deer species, and are true transient skin‐penetrating structures. Antlers are subject to extreme loading during the rutting season and yet the skin–bone barrier remains intact. Here we show how deer antlers can be used as natural analogues for the successful development of specialized orthopaedic amputation prosthetics. We have used quantitative and qualitative findings from a study of the morphology of deer antlers to develop a device that mimics their structure, which creates a tight seal between the implant and the host tissues, for use in amputation prosthetics.},

This control strategy is significantly altered in those with upper limb amputation as sensations of touch and movement are inherently lost. For upper limb prosthetic users, the absence of sensory feedback impedes efficient use of the prosthesis and is highlighted as a major factor contributing to user rejection of myoelectric prostheses. Numerous sensory feedback systems have been proposed in literature to address this gap in prosthetic control; however, these systems have yet to be implemented for long term use. Methodologies for communicating prosthetic grasp and touch information are reviewed, including discussion of selected designs and test results.

	abstract = {Introduction 
        Sensory feedback is largely unavailable for persons with upper-limb amputation with conventional prostheses. The current study created a portable vibratory haptic feedback system integrated into the prosthesis to test its usefulness in gripping objects during daily life.
        Materials and Methods 
        Development involved optimizing a mapping algorithm between the force sensor and the feedback tactor vibration, developing a custom process for mounting a wireless force sensor onto the prosthetic thumb with reliable output, and developing an instrumented object for testing grip force accuracy. Clinical testing involved optimizing tactor placement, measuring grip force accuracy, measuring the ability to perform daily gripping tasks, and surveying prosthetic users' opinion of the system after using the vibratory haptic device at home. A total of six individuals with unilateral transradial amputation participated in this study.
        Results 
        The results demonstrated optimal tactor placement more proximal versus distal on the forearm. Accuracy with haptic versus no haptic feedback demonstrated that haptic feedback improved the grip force accuracy by 129\% (adjusted P = 0.041) for light grip force target (2 lb or 0.9 kg) in the nonportable system and 21\% (adjusted P = 0.051) for medium grip force target (10 lb or 4.5 kg) in the portable system. Haptic feedback did not statistically improve grip accuracy at strong grip forces (20 lb or 9.1 kg). Haptic feedback improved the gripping technique during the Assessment of Capacity for Myoelectric Control (ACMC) by 1.22 points, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.27, n = 4). The participants provided specific positive examples of how the vibratory haptic system was useful at home. The overall usability score was 3.6 where 4 indicated excellent and 0 indicated poor.
        Conclusions 
        This kind of system has potential to improve the lives of upper-limb prosthetic users.},

	abstract = {Somatosensory feedback of the hand is essential for object identification. Without somatosensory feedback, individuals cannot reliably determine the size or compliance of an object. Electrical nerve stimulation can restore localized tactile and proprioceptive feedback with intensity discrimination capability similar to natural sensation. We hypothesized that adding artificial somatosensation improves object recognition accuracy when using a prosthesis. To test this hypothesis, we provided different forms of sensory feedback–tactile, proprioceptive, or both–to two subjects with upper limb loss. The subjects were asked to identify the size or mechanical compliance of different foam blocks placed in the prosthetic hand while visually and audibly blinded. During trials, we did not inform the subjects of their performance, but did ask them about their confidence in correctly identifying objects. Finally, we recorded applied pressures during object interaction. Subjects were free to use any strategy they chose to examine the objects. Object identification was most accurate with both tactile and proprioceptive feedback. The relative importance of each type of feedback, however, depended on object characteristics and task. Sensory feedback increased subject confidence and was directly correlated with accuracy. Subjects applied less pressure to the objects when they had tactile pressure feedback. Artificial somatosensory feedback improves object recognition and the relative importance of tactile versus proprioceptive feedback depends on the test set. We believe this test battery provides an effective means to assess the impact of sensory restoration and the relative contribution of different forms of feedback (tactile vs. kinesthetic) within the neurorehabilitation field.},

abstract = {Endo-exo prosthetics (EEP), which belongs to the transcutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic systems (TOPS), provides an alternative bone-anchored rehabilitation method for transfemoral amputees. It led to the question of whether transmitted forces from prosthetic feet are perceptible by osseoperception resulting in proprioceptive feedback of ground conditions.
The following hypotheses emerged for our trial with the null hypothesis: EEP fitting after transfemoral amputation does not influence osseoperception. Alternative hypothesis 1: EEP patients achieve better osseoperception results than transfemoral amputees fitted with socket prosthesis. Alternative hypothesis 2: EEP carriers achieve comparable results with regards to their osseoperception as non-amputees.
N = 25 patients with EEP (mean age = 50,6 ± 9,4, male/female = 15/10) N = 25 patients with socket prostheses (mean age = 52,6 ± 13,1, male/female = 19/6) and N = 25 healthy volunteers were included in the experimental case-control study. In three blinded test modules (V1, V2, V3), the participants had to identify different degrees of shore hardness (c) of different materials (rubber balls (shore = 5-25c), foam cushions (shore = 5-30c), foam mats (shore = 5-30c) with their prosthetic foot (or a personally defined foot in healthy volunteers) without footwear and had to rank them into the correct order according to their tactile sensation and the degree of hardness. A maximum of 10 points could be scored per run.
This experimental observational study included N = 75 participants. The mean age for the entire cohort was 42.8 ± 16.6 years and the BMI was 26.0 ± 4.8. Our results show a significant level of differences in tactile osseoperception between all groups (p < 0.001). A correlation between the mean values of V1-3 and the PMQ2.0 as well as the mean values of K-Level and the prosthesis wearing time per day showed for PMQ (r = 0.387, p = 0.006) and K-level (r = 0.448, p = 0.001) which is a moderate effect according to Cohen.
Our study results suggest that the EEP treatment can lead to an improvement in tactile sensory perception via the bone-anchored implant, which can lead to an increase in quality of life and improved gait safety.},
