abstract = {BACKGROUND:A combined approach for prosthetic attachment and control using a transcutaneous bone-anchored device and implanted muscle electrodes can improve function for upper-limb amputees. The bone-anchor provides a transcutaneous feed-through for muscle signal recording. This approach can be combined with targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) to further improve myoelectric control.
METHODS:A bone-anchored device was implanted trans-tibially in n = 8 sheep with a bipolar recording electrode secured epimysially to the peroneus tertius muscle. TMR was carried out in a single animalthe peroneus tertius was deinnervated and the distal portion of the transected nerve to the peroneus muscle was coapted to a transected nerve branch previously supplying the tibialis anterior muscle. For 12 weeks (TMR) or 19 weeks (standard procedure), epimysial muscle signals were recorded while animals walked at 2 km·h.
RESULTS:After 19 weeks implantation following standard procedure, epimysial recording signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was 18.7 dB (± 6.4 dB, 95% CI) with typical recordings falling in the range 10–25 dB. Recoveries in gait and muscle signals were coincident 6 weeks post-TMR; initial muscle activity was identifiable 3 weeks post-TMR though with low signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio compared with normal muscle recordings.
CONCLUSIONS:Following recovery, muscle signals were recorded reliably over 19 weeks following implantation. In this study, targeted reinnervation was successful in parallel with bone-anchor implantation, with recovery identified 6 weeks after surgery.},

	abstract = {Exoprosthetic replacement with an artificial limb is the main option for reconstruction after traumatic amputation of an upper limb. Direct skeletal attachment using an osseointegrated implant improves the ease of fixation of the exoprosthesis to the amputation stump. We now report the use of an intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthesis that is designed to achieve osseocutaneous integration. Osseocutaneous integration differs from osseointegration because the aim is to create a stable interface among the implant, the bone, and the soft tissues. This reduces the risk of soft tissue infection and troublesome discharge, which are problems encountered with current osseointegrated implants that focus largely on the bone–implant interface. We describe our experience with an intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthesis in a case of transhumeral amputation with 2 years of follow-up.},

abstract = {The human body has evolved to maintain homeostasis through the covering of skin and mucous membranes, which separate the internal environment from the harsh and variable external milieu. Few structures naturally penetrate these coverings, and teeth are the only exception in human beings. Attempts to breach these barriers, to develop skin‐ penetrating, bone‐anchored amputation prostheses, can lead to opportunist invasion by microorganisms and subsequent infection, which can jeopardize the life of the individual. There are only a few fascinating examples where the integument of other species is interrupted without such dire consequences, and the deer antler is one such case. Deer antlers are cephalic bony appendages arising from the frontal bones of the skull of the males of most deer species, and are true transient skin‐penetrating structures. Antlers are subject to extreme loading during the rutting season and yet the skin–bone barrier remains intact. Here we show how deer antlers can be used as natural analogues for the successful development of specialized orthopaedic amputation prosthetics. We have used quantitative and qualitative findings from a study of the morphology of deer antlers to develop a device that mimics their structure, which creates a tight seal between the implant and the host tissues, for use in amputation prosthetics.},
