\paragraph{Stress shielding \& non-physiological loads}

\paragraph{Aseptic loosening}

\paragraph{Bone-anchored prostheses are extremely niche}

\paragraph{Delay introduced by EMG}
Given this setup, a prosthetic limb would have some delay due to the EMG recording, then more delay due to motor signals. This process is likely to take much longer than secondary cues users tend to rely on \cite{schofield_applications_2014}, e.g., localised pressure on their prosthesis or a particular sound it makes.
