The paper concludes that over the study period, muscle signals were recorded reliably and targeted muscle reinnervation was a success; with particular emphasis on identifiable recovery 6 weeks after surgery.
It also highlights that ITAP as a portal for the wiring is suitable not just for muscular recordings, but also neural --- supporting ITAP as a wiring path for different modalities of sophisticated limb prosthetics.
