This research is mainly a combined approach using a transcutaneous bone-anchored device and implanted muscle electrodes. Traditional prostheses can not enable patients to have an environment perception, thus Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prostheses (ITAP) was tested on sheep in this paper and it may provide a better way to improve patients' life quality in the future.
