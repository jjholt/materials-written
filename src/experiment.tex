ITAP was sintered from Titanium 6--4 and press-fit into the sheep's tibia. Because it was press-fit, it included a hydroxyapatite coating to promote osseointegration.
Reinforced bipolar electrode arrays with platinum-iridium electrodes were implanted aligned with the long-axis of the muscles.
Gaps were filled with epoxy resin and medical grade silicone.

The experiment consisted of placing each animal on a treadmill walking at \SI{2}{\kilo\metre\per\hour} and having electromyographical (EMG) readings in weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 14 and 19 after the implantation.
On the 19th week, EMG was recorded on the skin surface for comparison.

For the animal that underwent TMR, EMG was recorded weekly for 12 weeks in the same setting.
A force plate analysis was also used to assess recovery of weight bearing.
That is, before and regularly after surgery the animal walked across a force plate, then weight distribution on each hind leg was measured.

The authors also analyse the change in electrode impedance before implantantion, in-vivo and after explantation.
